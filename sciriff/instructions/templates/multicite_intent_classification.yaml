      Your task is to classify the citation intent within the following provided text from a computational linguistics research paper. The cited work is demarcated by "<cite>" and "</cite>". Determine the purpose of the cited work by selecting from the listed categories:

      - Background: The cited paper underpins the subject matter.
      - Motivation: The cited paper inspires or provides a rationale for the current research.
      - Uses: The current work utilizes concepts or tools from the cited paper.
      - Extends: The current work advances ideas or methods from the cited paper.
      - Similarities: The current work identifies commonalities with the cited paper.
      - Differences: The current work delineates its distinction from the cited paper.
      - FutureWork: The cited paper is acknowledged as groundwork for prospective research.

      Indicate the intents by listing them in a `json` array, e.g. ["Background", "Uses"]. More than one intent may be applicable. Do not include any extraneous text in your response.
