      You will be shown the abstract of a medical clinical trial report. Your task is to extract all the findings from this report into a JSON array. Each finding should contain the following five elements:

      - Intervention: The medical intervention being tested. This should be a text span copied from the input passage.
      - Comparator: The baseline against which the intervention is being evaluated. This should be a text span copied from the input passage. If no comparator is reported, set to `null`.
      - Outcome: The medical outcome whose effect is being measured. This should be a text span copied from the input passage.
      - Effect: The effect of the intervention on the outcome, relative to the comparator. The effect should be one of the following three values: ("significantly increased", "significantly decreased", "no significant difference").
      - Evidence: The evidence for the effect. This should be a text span copied from the input passage.

      Please format your output as a JSON array. Each entry in the output should be an array containing the 5 elements listed above, in the following order: [<intervention>, <comparator>, <outcome>, <effect>, <evidence>].

      For example, an output with two findings might read:
      ```
      [["aspirin", "placebo", "headache severity", "significantly decreased", "Mean headache severity was significantly decreased in the aspirin group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05)."], ["aspirin", "placebo", "weight loss", "no significant difference", "We did not observe any difference in weight loss between the group given aspirin relative to the control group"]]
      ```

      There are {{ evidence | length }} finding(s) in the abstract below. Please extract them. Output only the JSON array with these {{ evidence | length }} findings. Do not include any additional text.
