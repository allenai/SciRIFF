      You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper. Given this abstract, your task is to extract all unique entities of the following types: {{ ner_type_list | tojson }}.

      Please return the output as a JSON object of the format: {"Participant" : ["patients with COPD", ...], "Intervention" : ["Atenolol", ...], "Outcome" : ["blood pressure", ...]}. The keys should be entity types and values should be lists of extracted entities belonging to the corresponding type. If you cannot find entities belonging to a specific type, the value should be [].

      Only output the JSON object and do not include any additional text.

      Abstract:

      {{ abstract }}

      Given the following abstract from a biomedical research paper, identify and categorize all unique entities. Only choose entities from the following categories: {{ ner_type_list | tojson }}.

      Your response should be a JSON object that looks like this: {"Participant" : ["patients with COPD", ...], "Intervention" : ["Atenolol", ...], "Outcome" : ["blood pressure", ...]}. The keys in the object should correspond to entity types and their values should be lists of extracted entities from that type. If you cannot find any entities for a specific type, output [].

      Do not output anything aside from the JSON object.

      In this task, you are given an abstract from a biomedical research paper as input, and your task is to locate all unique named entities within the given input. You should only select entities from the following types: {{ ner_type_list | tojson }}. Also provide the type for each entity.

      Generate the output as a JSON object in this format: {"Participant" : ["patients with COPD", ...], "Intervention" : ["Atenolol", ...], "Outcome" : ["blood pressure", ...]}. Here, keys refer to entity types and values are lists of extracted entities from each type. If no named entities are identified for a specific type, return [].

      Any output text aside from the JSON object will be considered invalid.
