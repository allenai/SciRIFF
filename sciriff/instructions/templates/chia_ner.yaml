      You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial. Given these criteria, your task is to extract all unique entities of the following types: {{ ner_type_list | tojson }}.

      Please return the output as a JSON object of the format: {"Condition" : ["breast cancer", ...], "Device" : ["ports", ...], "Drug" : ["Atenolol", ...], "Measurement" : ["blood pressure", ...], "Mood" : ["suspected", ...], "Multiplier" : ["more than two", ...], "Negation" : ["no", ...], "Observation" : ["history", ...], "Person" : ["male", ...], "Procedure" : ["surgery", ...], "Qualifier" : ["severe", ...], "ReferencePoint" : ["enrollment", ...], "Scope" : ["infection", ...], "Temporal" : ["one day", ...], "Value" : ["50%", ...], "Visit" : ["ICU", ...]}. The keys should be entity types and values should be lists of extracted entities belonging to the corresponding type. If you cannot find entities belonging to a specific type, the value should be [].

      Only output the JSON object and do not include any additional text.

      Abstract:

      {{ abstract }}

      Given the following abstract from a biomedical research paper, identify and categorize all unique entities. Only choose entities from the following categories: {{ ner_type_list | tojson }}.

      Your response should be a JSON object that looks like this: {"Condition" : ["breast cancer", ...], "Device" : ["ports", ...], "Drug" : ["Atenolol", ...], "Measurement" : ["blood pressure", ...], "Mood" : ["suspected", ...], "Multiplier" : ["more than two", ...], "Negation" : ["no", ...], "Observation" : ["history", ...], "Person" : ["male", ...], "Procedure" : ["surgery", ...], "Qualifier" : ["severe", ...], "ReferencePoint" : ["enrollment", ...], "Scope" : ["infection", ...], "Temporal" : ["one day", ...], "Value" : ["50%", ...], "Visit" : ["ICU", ...]}. The keys in the object should correspond to entity types and their values should be lists of extracted entities from that type. If you cannot find any entities for a specific type, output [].

      Do not output anything aside from the JSON object.

      In this task, you are given an abstract from a biomedical research paper as input, and your task is to locate all unique named entities within the given input. You should only select entities from the following types: {{ ner_type_list | tojson }}. Also provide the type for each entity.

      Generate the output as a JSON object in this format: {"Condition" : ["breast cancer", ...], "Device" : ["ports", ...], "Drug" : ["Atenolol", ...], "Measurement" : ["blood pressure", ...], "Mood" : ["suspected", ...], "Multiplier" : ["more than two", ...], "Negation" : ["no", ...], "Observation" : ["history", ...], "Person" : ["male", ...], "Procedure" : ["surgery", ...], "Qualifier" : ["severe", ...], "ReferencePoint" : ["enrollment", ...], "Scope" : ["infection", ...], "Temporal" : ["one day", ...], "Value" : ["50%", ...], "Visit" : ["ICU", ...]}. Here, keys refer to entity types and values are lists of extracted entities from each type. If no named entities are identified for a specific type, return [].

      Any output text aside from the JSON object will be considered invalid.

      Input Text:

      {{ abstract }}
