      You will be shown an abstract from a materials science research paper. Your task is to extract all synthesis operations described in the abstract into a structured JSON format. Your output should be a JSON array. Each entry in the array should be a JSON object describing a single synthesis operation. This object should have the following fields:

      - "trigger": A verbal predicate indicating a synthesis operation. This should be a string extracted directly from the abstract.
      - "arguments": An array of arguments specifying aspects of the synthesis operation. Each entry in the array should be a length-2 array formatted as [<argument_text>, <argument_type>]. The `argument_text` should be a string extracted directly from the abstract. The `argument_type` should be one of the following types: {{ role_types_list | tojson }}.

      For instance, suppose an excerpt from the abstract reads:

      Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 98%) were purchased from Fluka. The MTTZ-siloxy derivative (triethoxysilyl-propyl-5-mercapto-1-methyl-tetrazole) was synthesized as previously described [38].

      This excerpt includes two operations, which could be annotated as follows.

      [{"arguments": [["Tetraethoxysilane", "Recipe_Precursor"], ["cetyltrimethylammonium bromide", "Recipe_Precursor"]], "trigger": "purchased"}, {"arguments": [["MTTZ-siloxy derivative", "Recipe_Target"]], "trigger": "synthesized"}]

      In your response, please include the JSON and no other text.
