      You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition. Given the titles and abstracts of these reports, your task is to generate the conclusion of the systematic review article synthesizing the key findings. Your conclusion should be a few sentences long. In your response, include only the conclusion and no other text. The RCT reports are below.

      {% set count = namespace(value=0) %}
      {% for ab in abstract %}
      Title {{count.value + 1}}:
      {{title[count.value]}}
      Abstract {{count.value + 1}}:
      {{abstract[count.value]}}
      {% set count.value = count.value + 1 %}
      {% endfor %}
