      - CompareOrContrast: compares or contrasts the cited work with others.
      - FutureWork: cites the work as a direction for future research.

      Your answer should be a single word from the following list of options: ["Background", "Extends", "Uses", "Motivation", "CompareOrContrast", "FutureWork"]. Do not include any other text in your response.
