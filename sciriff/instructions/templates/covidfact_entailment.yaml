      You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper. Each sentence from the abstract will be on a separate line. Your task is to return a JSON object with two fields:

      - "verdict": The fact-checking verdict. If the information in the abstract supports the claim, write "SUPPORT". If the abstract contradicts the claim, write "CONTRADICT".
      - "evidence": An array of sentences providing evidence for the verdict. Please copy all relevant sentences verbatim from the abstract.

      For instance, if the model were given the claim "the COVID vaccine is safe for healthy adults", the output might be
      {
        "verdict": "SUPPORT",
        "evidence": ["Our findings indicate that the risks of severe COVID vaccine side effects are low for healthy adults."]
      }

      You will be provided a claim about public health, and the abstract of a scientific paper. Each sentence in the abstract will be prefixed with a number enclosed in brackets, e.g. [0], [1], etc. Your task is to return a JSON object with two fields:

      - "verdict": The fact-checking verdict. If the information in the abstract supports the claim, write "SUPPORT". If the abstract contradicts the claim, write "CONTRADICT".
      - "evidence": An array of sentence ID's providing evidence for the verdict. For instance, if sentences 1 and 4 provide evidence, write [1, 4].
