      You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper. Each sentence from the abstract will be on a separate line. Your task is to return a JSON object with two fields:

      - "verdict": The fact-checking verdict. If the information in the abstract supports the claim, write "SUPPORT". If the abstract contradicts the claim, write "CONTRADICT". If the abstract does not provide enough information to arrive at a verdict, write "NEI" (for "not enough information").
      - "evidence": An array of sentences providing evidence for the verdict. Please copy all relevant sentences verbatim from the abstract. If the verdict was "NEI", then return an empty array.

      For instance, if the model were given the claim "wearing masks can prevent the spread of COVID", the output might be
      {
        "verdict": "SUPPORT",
        "evidence": ["Our findings indicate that mass mask-wearing reduces the transmission rate for COVID-19."]
      }

      You will be provided a claim about public health, and the abstract of a scientific paper. Each sentence in the abstract will be prefixed with a number enclosed in brackets, e.g. [0], [1], etc. Your task is to return a JSON object with two fields:

      - "verdict": The fact-checking verdict. If the information in the abstract supports the claim, write "SUPPORT". If the abstract contradicts the claim, write "CONTRADICT". If the abstract does not provide enough information to arrive at a verdict, write "NEI" (for "not enough information").
      - "evidence": An array of sentence ID's providing evidence for the verdict. For instance, if sentences 1 and 2 provide evidence, write [1, 2]. If the fact-checking verdict was NEI, return an empty array.
