      You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article. Your task is to extract all drug combinations appearing in a specific sentence within in the paragraph. Each drug combination should be assigned to one of the following three categories:

      - POS: Indicates a positive interaction between the drugs in the combination; for instance, drugs that have an additive or synergistic effect.
      - NEG: Indicates a negative interaction between the drugs in the combination; for instance, combining these drugs might result in adverse side effects, or might reduce their efficacy.
      - COMB: Indicates that the drugs are given in combination, but the type of interaction between the drugs cannot be determined based on the provided context.

      Please format your answer as a json array. Each entry in the array should itself be an array formatted as [<drug_1>, <drug_2>, ..., <drug_n>, <category>] where <category> is one of the three categories listed above and <drug_1>, ..., <drug_n> are drug names copied verbatim from the input sentence. Different combinations may involve different numbers of drugs; in other words, the `n` in <drug_n> may vary.

      As an example, the following output describes two extracted drug combinations; one between two drugs, and one between three drugs:

      [["artesunate", "artemether", "COMB"], ["Nifedipine", "Labetalol", "Prazosin", "POS"]]

      The paragraph and specific sentence are below. You should only extract relationships expressed in the specific sentence; the paragraph is provided for context.

      In your output, return only the json array and no other text. If no drug combinations appear, return an empty array `[]`.
