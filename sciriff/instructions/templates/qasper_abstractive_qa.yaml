      You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper. Paragraphs in the paper are separated by newlines. Your task is to answer the question based on the contents of the paper.

      Paper:
      ----------------------------------------
      {{paper}}
      ----------------------------------------

      Question: {{question}}

      To answer the question, format your response as a `json` object with two fields:

      "answer": A string providing a succinct answer to the question, in your own words.
      "evidence": An array of strings. Each entry should be a full paragraph from the paper. Together, the evidence should serve as a justification for the answer.

      For instance, for the question "What baselines did the authors compare against?", a sample response might be:

      {
        "answer": "BERT and RoBERTa."
        "evidence": ["We compare our approach against two baselines. In Table 1, we compare against BERT. In Table 2, we compare against RoBERTa. Our findings indicate that our approach improves over both baeslines..."]
      }

      The "answer" field should be roughly {{ answer | length }} characters in length.

      Do not include any text in your response other than the json. If the question is unanswerable given the provided excerpts, respond with the single word "null".

      To repeat, the question is: {{question}}

      Answer JSON object:

      |||

      {% if unanswerable %}
      null
      {% else %}
      {{ {"answer": answer, "evidence": evidence} | tojson }}
      {% endif %}
