      You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper. Your task is to answer the question based on the contents of the paper. Your response should be a `json` object with two fields:

      "answer": An array of strings extracted directly from the paper which, collectively, answer the question.
      "evidence": An array of strings. Each should be an excerpt from the paper, in which one or more of the extracted answers can be found.

      For instance, for the question "What baselines did the authors compare against?", a sample response might be:

      {
        "answer": ["BERT", "RoBERTa"],
        "evidence": ["In our experiments, we compare the performance of our model against BERT and RoBERTa."]
      }

      Do not include any text in your response other than the json.

      If the question is unanswerable given the provided excerpts, respond with the single word "null".

      Paper: {{paper}}

      Question: {{question}}

      {% if unanswerable %}
      null
      {% else %}
      {{ {"answer": answer, "evidence": evidence} | tojson }}
      {% endif %}
